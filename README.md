# GUI-based-User-Interaction-Program
This Java program uses JOptionPane from javax.swing to create a simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) for user interaction. It prompts the user to input their name, age, and height using dialog boxes and displays the entered values in message dialogs. The input values are processed using string parsing for integer and double conversions. This serves as a basic example of GUI programming in Java. ðŸš€
